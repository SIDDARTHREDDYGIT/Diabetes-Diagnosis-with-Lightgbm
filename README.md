DIABETES DIAGNOSIS WITH ML USING LIGHTGBM AND OPTIMIZATION TECNIQUE

Overview:

This project implements a Diabetes Diagnosis System using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, and model training, providing a complete end-to-end pipeline for medical prediction tasks.



NOVELTY:

 LightGBM Classifier â€“ leveraged for its efficiency and high performance on tabular medical data.

 Bayesian Optimization â€“ applied for hyperparameter tuning, enabling smarter and faster convergence compared to grid/random search.

 Comparative analysis across multiple ML classifiers with evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

 Dataset Exploration:

The project uses the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle, a widely used benchmark dataset for medical ML tasks.

Source: Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset â€“ Kaggle

Instances: 768

Features: 8 medical predictors (e.g., Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Insulin, Age) and 1 target variable (Outcome).

Target Variable:

1 â†’ Patient likely has diabetes

0 â†’ Patient not likely to have diabetes

The dataset is imbalanced, making evaluation metrics like Recall and ROC-AUC crucial in addition to Accuracy.

Features:

Data preprocessing & missing value handling

Visualization with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly

Standardization and feature scaling

Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.)

Hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization

Model evaluation & performance comparison

Tech Stack:

Python

Scikit-learn

LightGBM

 Results:

LightGBM with Bayesian Optimization achieved the best predictive performance compared to baseline models.

Demonstrated strong balance between accuracy and recall, making it a suitable choice for medical prediction tasks where minimizing false negatives is critical.

Future Work:

Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.

Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., TabNet, Autoencoders).

Incorporate explainability tools like SHAP to improve model interpretability.
